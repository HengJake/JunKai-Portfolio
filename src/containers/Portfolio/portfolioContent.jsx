With increased screen time and prolonged sitting during online classes, posture-related health issues have become more common. To address this, a custom-designed standing study table was created to promote better posture, reduce back strain, and encourage active learning. The project merges ergonomic principles with practical design to support a healthier virtual learning experience.",
